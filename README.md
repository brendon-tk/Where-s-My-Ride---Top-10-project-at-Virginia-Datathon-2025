# 🚌 where's my ride?

a datathon project by **code blooded**  
built to solve one v relatable question: _“did i just miss the bus???”_

this app helps users get real-time predictions for bus travel, smart alternatives if they miss it, and personalized mobility recs using machine learning + transit data.

---

## 🧠 what it does

- 🔍 lets you enter your starting point, destination, time, and day
- 🧠 predicts bus travel duration based on real-world data
- ⚠️ tells you if you’ll make it or if the bus already left you in the dust
- 🚲 suggests other options like scooter, walk, or bike
- 💡 keeps it simple and fast, just like your ride should be

---

## 🛠 how it works

under the hood:
- live data feeds from transit + micromobility sources
- a machine learning model trained on stop sequences, distance, coordinates, and duration
- correlation analysis + actual vs predicted plots
- recommendations based on travel time, weather, and bus availability
